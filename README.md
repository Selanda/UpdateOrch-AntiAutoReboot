# UpdateOrch-AntiAutoReboot
Batch script to forcefully break UpdateOrchestrator's ability to automatically restart Windows 10. Tested as working on the version 20H2 update.

Needs to be run as administrator to function properly, regardless of if you choose to run the batch file or the executable release.
