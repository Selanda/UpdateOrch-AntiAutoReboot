# UpdateOrch-AntiAutoReboot
_Tested as working on Win10 & Win11 build 21H2._

Batch script to forcefully break UpdateOrchestrator's ability to automatically restart Windows 10 & 11. 

Executible needs to be run as administrator to function properly. 
If you choose to download the batch file you will need a copy of PsExec located in the same folder as it is required by step 4; one is helpfully included in the repository if needed.

**Please read the release notes prior to downloading the executible.**
